# User Authentication Guide

## Account Security Features

The Agent Platform provides multiple layers of security for your account:

1. **Password Protection**
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
3. **Session Management**
4. **Login Notifications**

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

### Step 1: Enable 2FA
1. Go to your Profile Settings
2. Click "Security"
3. Select "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"

### Step 2: Scan QR Code
1. Use an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) to scan the QR code
2. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app to verify

### Step 3: Save Backup Codes
1. Download or copy the backup codes
2. Store them in a secure location
3. These codes can be used if you lose access to your authenticator app

## Using Two-Factor Authentication

### Logging In with 2FA
1. Enter your username and password
2. When prompted, enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
3. Click "Verify" to complete login

### Managing 2FA Settings
- **Change Authenticator Device**: Generate new QR code
- **Disable 2FA**: Requires password confirmation
- **View Backup Codes**: Regenerate if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Authenticator Access
1. Use one of your backup codes to login
2. Go to Security Settings
3. Disable and re-enable 2FA with new device

### Invalid Codes
1. Ensure your device time is synchronized
2. Check that you're using the correct account
3. Try generating a new code

## Security Best Practices

1. Use a strong, unique password
2. Enable 2FA for added security
3. Regularly review active sessions
4. Update your password periodically
5. Be cautious of phishing attempts
