## Realtime Documentation MCP Details

The Realtime Documentation MCP works by:

1. Watching all files in the project directory for changes
2. Automatically generating documentation when files are:
   - Added
   - Modified
   - Deleted
3. Supporting multiple file types:
   - JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Python
   - Generic files
4. Storing documentation in a /docs directory with the same structure as the source
5. Providing real-time updates through:
   - File system events
   - API endpoints
   - WebSocket notifications

Key Features:
- Automatic documentation generation
- Real-time updates
- File type specific documentation
- Markdown formatting
- Prettier integration for consistent formatting
- Ignore patterns for node_modules, .git, etc.
